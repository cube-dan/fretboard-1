<h1>Introduction to 4ths tuning</h1>
<p>
4ths tuning is based on making all strings tuned one
just 4th apart. This has the advantage (over the standard guitar
tuning) that every fingering
(provided no open strings are involved) is moveable across the
fretboard, so your learning of fingerings is minimised.
</p>

<h2>Major scales</h2>
<p>
As an example, this is what a G major scale looks like on
a guitar tuned in E 4ths (the root notes, G, are red). Note
the symmetry of the patterns repeating all over the fingerboard:
</p>
<div class="fb-container" data-notes="g major"></div>
<p>
Notice how e.g. starting from any of the G notes with a given
finger, you can play the exact same fingering pattern starting
from different frets and different strings. If you have
already been playing guitar for a while, you will realise how
much simpler this is to memorise than with standard guitar
tuning.
</p>
<p>
Look at this basic layout for one octave of G major, if
you start from your first finger:
</p>
<script>
    var fb = Fretboard({frets: 8});
    fb.placeNotes("6:g2 6:a2 6:b2 5:c3 5:d3 5:e3 4:f#3");
    fb.placeNotes("4:g3");
</script>
<p>
Starting from your second finger:
</p>
<script>
    var fb = Fretboard({frets: 8});
    fb.placeNotes("6:g2 6:a2 5:b2 5:c3 5:d3 4:e3 4:f#3");
    fb.placeNotes("4:g3");
</script>
<p>
Starting from your fourth finger:
</p>
<script>
    var fb = Fretboard({frets: 8});
    fb.placeNotes("4:g3 3:a3 3:b3 3:c4 2:d4 2:e4 2:f#4");
    fb.placeNotes("1:g4");
</script>

<p>
All of the notes of the G major scale based on a fixed position starting
on the 3rd fret, which you can view as chaining the former fingerings:
</p>
<script>
    var gMajor = Fretboard({frets: 8});
    gMajor.placeNotes("6:g2 6:a2 6:b2 5:c3 5:d3 5:e3 4:f#3");
    gMajor.placeNotes("4:g3 4:a3 3:b3 3:c4 3:d4 2:e4 2:f#4");
    gMajor.placeNotes("2:g4 1:a4 1:b4 1:c5");
</script>

<p>
Similarly, but based on the 2nd fret:
</p>
<script>
    var gMajor = Fretboard({frets: 8});
    gMajor.placeNotes("6:g2 6:f#2 6:a2 5:b2 5:c3 5:d3 4:e3 4:f#3");
    gMajor.placeNotes("4:g3 3:a3 3:b3 3:c4 2:d4 2:e4 2:f#4");
    gMajor.placeNotes("1:g4 1:a4 1:b4");
</script>

<p>
One of the things you may have started to notice is that all scales
that derive from a major scale can be comfortably played using
3 notes per string.
